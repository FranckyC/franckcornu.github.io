[{"categories":["modern-search"],"contents":"Since the 4.6.0 version of the PnP Modern Search solution, you can now configure sort fields for SharePoint/Microsoft Search data sources for both default sort and user sort (i.e sort results from the UI). As a result the previous \u0026ldquo;Edit sort order\u0026rdquo; option for data sources has been renamed to \u0026ldquo;Edit sort settings\u0026rdquo;.\nThat was a long awaited feature already present in v3 but not migrated to v4 due to the new architecture. This is now fixed :D.\nWhat changes compared to previous versions? The first difference regarding the configuration is about the properties listed in the sort fields dropdown. Now the list is a static list representing all \u0026ldquo;Sortable\u0026rdquo; properties in the SharePoint search schema:\nHowever, if a property is missing or you need to use a custom property like RefinableString or RefinableDate, you can sill type the property name manually in the dropdown and press \u0026lsquo;Enter\u0026rsquo; to validate. Remember the property should be \u0026ldquo;Sortable\u0026rdquo; in the search schema to get it work as there is no error validation anymore.\nThen you can now decide for a property to be used either for default sorting or user sorting or both. For instance if you want to sort the results initialy by the Created managed property in ascending direction and also allow users to change this direction afterwards, you can set this property as user sort as well with a friendly name for users (i.e. the name that will appeart in the sort dropdown). You can also set other properties to only be sortable in the UI but not as default, like RefinableString01:\nOnce an user sort property is added in the configuration, a sort drop down control appears in the layout (if you don\u0026rsquo;t set any \u0026lsquo;User sort\u0026rsquo; property, the control does not appear):\n The dropdown control appears on all layouts (except the \u0026lsquo;Details List\u0026rsquo;)\n To sort results on a property, simply click on the property you want to sort in the list (1) and then select the direction (2) ascending or descending.\nHowever, here are few things to know about the sort control:\n  By default, when the page opens, the sort order will be the one represented by all properties set as \u0026lsquo;Default sort\u0026rsquo; in the configuration (all combined together according to the definition order).\n  You can\u0026rsquo;t preselect a property in the sort dropdown even if it is configured as a default sort property. It means users don\u0026rsquo;t kow what is the default sort order.\n  Although you can set multiple properties as user sort in the configuration, you can sort on only one property at a time in the UI.\n  The default sort direction when you click on a property is always ascending (and you can\u0026rsquo;t change this).\n  You can reset the default sort order by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; option:\n  Details list layout specificity We\u0026rsquo;ve also updated the Details List layout sort options to match this new behavior as it contains its own sort settings. Now in the column option you can make a specific column sortable by choosing among the properties you configured as \u0026lsquo;User sort\u0026rsquo; in the data source sort configuration (and only these ones):\nIn the update process, we\u0026rsquo;ve also removed the static sorting behavior since it was too confusing for users. Now when you sort a specific column, all resuts in the data set are sorted, not only the current page (i.e. a new search request is made):\nHope you will find this new feature useful! Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to provide your feedback in the GitHub repository.\n","date":"April 8, 2022","image":null,"permalink":"/post/modern-search-overview-sort-control/","title":"New sort feature with the 4.6.0 PnP Modern Search version!"},{"categories":["general"],"contents":"The new SharePoint Online content type hub is a really geat feature to ensure a standardized information architecture across the company. Compared to the previous version, a lot of improvements has been made, especially the synchronization process with consumer sites which is now much faster and convenient.\nHowever, to be able to add content types in a library or list coming from the hub in a specific SharePoint site, you must first synchronize them. Otherwise you will get a Not found error during the addition.\nIf like me, you work with the content type hub programmatically to provide site templates, here are some ways to do that depending your implementation strategy:\nSynchronize with CSOM and REST (example with a Logic App) Unfortunately, and as far as I know, there is no Microsoft Graph REST endpoint that can be used to do this synhronization for a single site.

It went quite unnoticed at the time but it actually unlocks a lot of cool new scenarios requiring dynamic filtering, for instance, to build dynamic dashboards experiences. In this article I will review how this works and how you can benefit from this feature for your search pages.\nHow to connect two search results Web Parts together? Prerequisite: understand how dynamic filering works When you connect two Web Parts together, you basically match a value from a selected source item property against a value contained in a property target items. In other terms, when an item is selected:\n \u0026ldquo;Retrieve all items where the property X contains the value of the property Y of the selected item\u0026rdquo;\n Notice that properties don\u0026rsquo;t need to be necessarily the same in both sides as two different properties can share common values. You can already experience this configuration with the dynamic filtering feature for List and Library default Web Parts:\nThe concept is the same with PnP Search Results Web Parts, except you get more flexibility on how the query is made.\nExample with a taxonomy column To illustrate the item selection feature between two Search Results Web Parts, I take the example of a devices catalog that should display the related documentation when the user select one or more device from the list:\nTo make the link between items, the two lists share a same managed metadata column named \u0026ldquo;Related product\u0026rdquo;:\nBeacuse, we use SharePoint search, I also created a corresponding managed property in the search schema using the term ID property (not the text one):\nThe Search Results Web Parts connection configuration is always done in two steps.\n1- Allow item selection in source Web Part The first step is to configure a source Web Part where items will be selected and then enable the item selection feature in the layout configuration page under Common options:\n Item selection is available for all layouts.\n You can also turn on/off multiple selection for results.\n2- Configure connection on target Web Part(s) The second step is to configure the connection in the target Web Parts, the one(s) where results should be filtered by selected items of the source one. In my case the documents related to a specific product. To achieve this, I add a new Web Part on the page and configure a base query to retrieve documents that will be filtered:\n You can connect multiple target Web Parts to a single source.\n The connection with the source Search Results Web Part is done on the third configuration page in the property pane. From here you have to set:\n The source search Results Web Part to use. If you select anything else than a search results Web Part, the configuration is simply reset. The property of the selected item containing the value to use as filter. In my case, I select the managed property name corresponding to my column. The property of items used to match the selected value. In my case, because the two lists share the same column, I can simply use the same managed property name (RefinableString04).   To see the list of the available values, the source/target Web Part must have results retrieved and properties added in the selected properties in the data source.   The selection mode. By default the filtering is done using refinement filters just like if you\u0026rsquo;ve selected a value from the Search Filters Web Part. However, this mode has two constraints:\n The target Web Part must display results initially (because you can\u0026rsquo;t refine empty results basically:/). The target property (i.e. destination field name) must be a refinable managed property in the search schema. It won\u0026rsquo;t work otherwise.    If you\u0026rsquo;ve enabled mutli selection in the source Web Part, the operator you want to use between selected values (AND/OR).\n  After doing these configurations, you should be able to filter (refine actually) values in the target Web Part.\nUse the manual selection mode The default selection mode constraints you to display a set of results at page load in target Web Parts which is, in some cases, not the behavior you neccessarily want in terms of UI experience. To bypass this limitation, a manual selection mode is available. When enabled, it is up to you to configure the query using the query template field in the data source and available tokens:\nQuery template in manual mode\n{? Path:{site.absoluteUrl}/Documentation {|RefinableString04:{filters.RefinableString04.valueAsText}} IsDocument:1}\nExplanation:\n {? ... }: Conditional operator. If a token is not resolved in the enclosed expression, the query won\u0026rsquo;t be submitted to the search engine (meaning you won\u0026rsquo;t get any default results). {| ... }: \u0026lsquo;OR\u0026rsquo; operator token that will expand the conditions with the OR KQL operator. Use {\u0026amp; ... } if you want and AND condition. {filters.RefinableString04.valueAsText}: Token that will be replaced dynamically by the selected item value. Only string values are supported here.  With this configuration, you won\u0026rsquo;t get any result at page load but only when you will select an item in the source Web Part. To completely hide target Web Part(s), you can also enable the \u0026quot;\u0026quot; option.\nConnection with native SharePoint \u0026lsquo;List\u0026rsquo; Or \u0026lsquo;Library\u0026rsquo; Web Parts The cool thing about the item selection feature is it supports connection with OOTB SharePoint Web Parts. It means you can configure a \u0026lsquo;List\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Library\u0026rsquo; Web Part as source and use the PnP Search Results Web Part(s) as targets.\n OOTB SharePoint Web Parts can only be used as source, not targets.\n In my previous example, I could totally substitute the PnP Search Results displaying devices from he list by the list itself using hte \u0026lsquo;List\u0026rsquo; Web Part. Also, because I\u0026rsquo;ve mapped the \u0026lsquo;Related Product\u0026rsquo; managed metadata column to the property RefinableString04 using the ows_taxId_\u0026lt;columnName\u0026gt;, I can perform the match based on the taxonomy term ID. Simple as that. The other configurations remaisn exactly the same, only the source changes.\nThis type of connection supports single and multi value selection as well:\nConclusion The new item selection feature of PnP Modern Search solution now unlocks many new scenarios to build amazing dynamic search experiences.
