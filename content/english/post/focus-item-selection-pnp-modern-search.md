## Remember thecollaborationcorner.com?

Wel...it's been quite a while since my last blog post. Actually I closed my previous blog (thecollaborationcorner.com) almost 3 years ago due to a lack of time and motivation. After a quite difficult period for me since the last two past years, I finally decided to go forward and open a blog again, but this time using cool new tools. The last one was built with Wordpress and became quite difficult to manage through years. That's why I chose **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** to do the job time.

I was hesitating with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) at some point but finally found Hugo way easier and cleaner to use, at least for me, especially the setup with GitHub pages.

## What you'll find on this blog?

For those who know me personally, they probably know I'm not a huge fan of social medias, unlike some people, I don't write content just for writing content to maintain my "online presence". I've just needed a space to write down my ideas, solutions and other articles related, of course, mainly to the PnP Modern Search activity, but also other topics like Azure, Microsoft 365 and software development practices in general!

I hope you will enjoy this new blog and I wish you a good year 2022!

Franck.
