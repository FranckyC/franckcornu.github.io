Finally. It's been a while I wanted to create this content but now it is live! I'm glad to announce I've released a complete course about usage and configuration for the [PnP Modern Search solution](https://github.com/microsoft-search/pnp-modern-search). This course arrives with the latest `4.5.4` version and should help you to use the solution at its full potential.

This course is divided in five main chapters, one for the installation, one for each Web Part and finally, end-to-end tutorials about business scenarios.

- Get started with the PnP Modern Search Solution
- Use  the Search Results Web Part
- Use the Search Filters Web Part
- Use the Search Box Web Part
- Use the Search Verticals Web Part
- Let's practice!

With these you get near of <ins>3 hours</ins> of content reviewing Web Parts configuration.

## Regularly updated content

This course is an evolving material. Some lessons or chapters may change or be updated in the future as long the solution evolves and/or according your feedback. By getting this course, you have access to new content and updates for free.

## Pay attention to the used version and lesson description

For all lessons, the used version of the PnP Modern Search is always mentionned in the lesson description. Make sure you are using the same version to ensure the same experience. Some features in lessons are quite new and not necessarily available for previous versions. 

Also, key notions are always summarized in the description to help to quickly identify important things to know.

## Get some help when needed

If you get stuck with something or don't understand a configuration presented in a lesson, you can still start the discussion using the button on the top right corner. 

I will be more than happy to provide you some answers an guidance. With this course, you have a privileged channel with the main author so use it when needed.

If you encounter a bug or you a not able to reproduce behavior demonstrated in a lesson, you can still open a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft-search/pnp-modern-search/issues) . We will review it sooner as we can.

## Your feedback is important!

Actually, as a PnP Modern Search user you are the best person to provide your feedback about features and usability. By doing this, you help me to build a better course and a better solution for the community.

I also plan to release an other course about all customizations scenarios you can have with the PnP Modern Search but later this year as it take quite some time to build.
