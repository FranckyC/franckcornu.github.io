I've been SharePoint & Microsoft 365 consultant for almost 10 years now and Office Development MVP, I’ve worked for several companies in many fields especially intranet solutions. Involved in the Pattern & Practices initiative, I’m the main author of the PnP Modern Search solution.

You won't find any better source of information than me about this solution ;)
